# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project!

## Filing Issues
- Clear repro case when submitting a bug
- Clear use case when submitting a feature request or change along with a proposed API
- Promote discussion! Let's talk about the change and discuss what the best, most flexible option might be.
- Include any workarounds that can be used to get around the issue at hand.
...

## Pull Requests
- Keep it simple! Code clean up and linting changes should be submitted as separate PRS from logic changes so the impact to the codebase is clear. Keep PRs with logic changes to the essential modifications if possible -- people have to read it!
- Open an issue for discussion first so we can have consensus on the change
- Reference the issue that the PR is addressing.
...

## Code Style
- Follow the `.editorconfig` and `.babelrc` style configurations included in the repo.
- Try to keep code as clear as possible! Code for readability!
- Longer, descriptive variable names are preferred to short ones.
- If a line of code includes a lot of nested statements (even just one or two) consider breaking the line up into multiple variables to improve the clarity of what's happening. 
- Include comments telling why a change was made. If code was moved from one part of a function to another, tell what happened and why the change got made so it doesn't get moved back. Comments aren't just for others, they're for your future self, too!
